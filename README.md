# Coursera-DE-C2-bash-cli-reverse-string
A lab on reversing a string in Bash using a cli

## Goal:  Bash CLI

For this project you will create a command-line tool that reverses a string

### Part 1: Run a script and pipe it into a string reversal bash utility `rev`

1.  Run the script `./palindromes.sh` to print a common list of palindromes (words that are the same backwards and forward).
2.  Now run them through a string reversal command:  `./palindromes.sh | rev`

### Part 2: Build a CLI string reverser tool

1.  Run the script `./reverse` with a few words to reverse them: `./reverse.sh foo bar biz`
2.  What happened?
3.  Modify the print statement slightly to use a ":" instead of a "-" in the output.

### Part 3: Build a CLI string reverser tool

1.  Run the following command:  `./palindromes.sh | xargs ./reverse.sh`
2.  Explain the output result and why `xargs` was necessary to achieve it.
